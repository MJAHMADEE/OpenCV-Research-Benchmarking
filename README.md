# OpenCV-Research-Benchmarking

This is the research project repository for a research paper writen by Amila Akagic, Emir Buza, Dzemil Dzigal (University of Sarajevo) and Nadja Dardagan and myself (Alpen-Adria-University Klagenfurt). Paper is finalized in May 2020. 

Our contributions with this paper are the benchmarks done on OpenCV object tracking algorithms (CSRT, TLD, MIL, MOSSE, Medianflow, Boosting, KCF). Benchmark is done on the OTB-100 dataset. For all further details, please refer to the paper provided in the repository.
